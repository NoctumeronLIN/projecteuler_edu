# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
# The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# So the thing is if we read left to right as "asasa" AND right to left "asasa" = then we got the point.
# To reach that we need take 100*100 in cycle from 100 to 999, take result like string and check spelling
